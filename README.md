## Quickstart Guide

- Drag and drop your data in OBJ, NRRD or Tiff format into the tree widget(crectangular space on the left side of the interface). You can add individual files or whole folders (including multiple folders).

- Within the tree widget, data can be freely organized. Groups and subgroups are supported. Multiple selection is enabled (use Shift+Left Click for range selection and Ctrl+Left Click for selecting multiple items). For annotation, six free-form comment fields are available.

- Checkmarks initially load the data. Later, you can control visibility using them. Check state functions are accessible via right-click or from the "Tree" menu.

- You can save and load your project progress. Save files are CSV-based and can be easily edited with Excel.
